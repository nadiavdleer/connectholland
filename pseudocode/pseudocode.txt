For sort_numerically:
    1. Convert words to integers:
        - Use extern component
        - Use own alogritm, by dividing units, tens, and hundreds/thousands/millions
            - convert one by one until all numbers are covered
    2. Sort integers in descending order
    3. Convert integers back to words and print

For all_anagram_groups:
    1. Simple first step: compare characters by using sorted()
    2. Advanced: take out space char and compare strings with spaces
