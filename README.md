# Assessment Connect Holland
## Nadia van der Leer

For this assessment I have (partially) solved two out of the five given problem statements. The first one I solved was the fifth problem, sort_numerically(). 
I found a library to convert words to numbers and vice-versa, which I used to be able to sort the list in a descending order. In the pseudocode I explained my way
of thinking for tackling this problem as well as an abstract idea for my own conversion algoritm.

The second problem I partially solved was the all_anagram_groups() function. Due to time I opted for a simple version of this algoritm that detects anagrams using 
sorted(), but only for one word. Strings consisting of multiple words divided by spaces are not (yet) covered.
